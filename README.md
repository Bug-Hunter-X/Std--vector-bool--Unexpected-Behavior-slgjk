This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, issue with using std::vector<bool> in C++.  The specialized implementation of std::vector<bool> in many standard libraries differs significantly from other standard containers. This difference can lead to hard-to-detect bugs if the programmer isn't fully aware of its peculiarities. The `bug.cpp` file shows example code that falls prey to these issues, and `bugSolution.cpp` presents an improved, safer alternative.
